- Built-in tool integration for extending AI capabilities (demonstrated with a weather tool example).
- Reasoning model support.
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components for a modern, responsive UI powered by [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).
- Built with the latest [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) App Router.


## Running Locally

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Install the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli):

   ```bash
   npm i -g vercel
   # or
   yarn global add vercel
   # or
   pnpm install -g vercel
   ```

   Once installed, link your local project to your Vercel project:

   ```bash
   vercel link
   ```

   After linking, pull your environment variables:

   ```bash
   vercel env pull
   ```

   This will create a `.env.local` file with all the necessary environment variables.

3. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   ```
